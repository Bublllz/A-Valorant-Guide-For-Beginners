    <h1><u>Top 6 Valorant Agents for Beginners:</u></h1><br>
    <h2>6:Raze:</h2>
    <p>Raze is a very good agent for starters if you like to run in and shoot them. This is alot of beginners playstiles, and thats why this agent is on the list. This agent is not for you if you like to think and stratergise your attack or how to lock down site.
    </p>
   <h2> 5:Omen</h2>
    <p>Unlike Raze, Omen is a agent that specialises in helping out the team take control of areas using his smokes, but also has a very high outplay potential. Using his smoke to tp in is a very storong part of his kit, but on the downside usialy only works in <abbr title="Iron To Gold">Low Elo</abbr> Because of it being highly predictable to more skilled players.
    </p>
    <h2>4:Reyna</h2>
    <p>
        Reyna is a very good agent for people who get lots of kills because 2 of her abilities are only used when or after you get a kill. One of the main reasons she is so good is that she can go in get one and get out removing a player from their team in the process. Her ultimate only being 6 poits is insane and <abbr title="Overpowered">OP</abbr> and more people sould be taking advantage of it while it is still avalible because <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en" title="This Takes You To The Offical Riot Games Page">Riot Games</a> Will nerf it soon.
    </p>
    <h2>
        3:Sage
    </h2>
    <p>
        Sage is a very good agent to learn for beginners because of her ability to be able to play passive or aggressave depending on your playstile. She also is very good for playing with your as all her ablilitys can be used to help the team.  
    </p>
    <h2>
        2:Jett
    </h2>
    <p>
        Most of Jettâ€™s difficulty lies in properly using her Updraft and Tailwind. Both abilities are movement abilities that allow Jett to get a better position to kill enemies. Jett is also insane when using the operator because before you peek you can activate your dash and when you need to get out you can.
    </p>
    <h2>
        1:Phoenix
    </h2>
    <p>
        Phoenix is great when played aggressively but can also work well when acting as a second fragger. His blinds can allow you to set up your teammate or yourself for kills. Your wall and molly can be used to heal or to clear corners and block vision. Also, his ultimate is one of the best in the game as you can get kills without putting yourself in danger.
